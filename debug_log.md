# Debug Log

**Explain how you used the VSCode debugger tools to uncover the bugs in Exercise 7. Be specific. What breakpoints did you set? Where did you step to? What made you realize the error?**

_Example: I set a breakpoint on line 5 and stepped until line 12. There, I discovered that the `x` variable had a value of `-3`, whereas it should have had a value of `7`. That made me realize that we should be adding the two numbers `x` and `y`, instead of subtracting._

I set a breakpoint on line 5. Then I put watch statements for a lot of the variables used in the if statements, including the length of the sentence and substring, `sentence[:len(start_str)]` and `start_str[len(start_str):]`, and the return statment `replace_str + replace_substring(remainder_of_sentence, start_str, replace_str)`. I then looked/jumped into the `replace_substring` function. This showed that the length of sentence is 0 (meaning there is nothing there), and then the function returns the 'sentence' which is just the first word. This is where the error seems to occur on line 10. For the remainder of the sentence, we need to call the following part of the sentence, not the start_str, so let's switch that out _change `remainder_of_sentence = start_str[len(start_str):]` to `remainder_of_sentence = sentence[len(start_str):]`_. After restarting and continuing from that error, we see a similar issue happen on line on line 13. I added watch variables for `sentence[0]`, `start_str[1:]`, and `sentence[1:]`. We call `start_str[1:]` which just gives us everything after the first character in the start string, not the sentence. Changing it to `replace_substring(sentence[1:], start_str, replace_str)` fixes the error.
